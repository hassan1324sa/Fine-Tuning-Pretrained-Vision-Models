Fine-Tuning Pretrained Vision Models

Overview

This repository contains an implementation of fine-tuning pretrained vision models using PyTorch. The project explores transfer learning techniques to adapt powerful vision models for custom tasks.

Features

Utilizes pretrained models such as ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet

Customizable fine-tuning pipeline

Supports multiple datasets for different vision tasks

Training and evaluation scripts included

Installation

To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:

pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib

Usage

Run the fine-tuning script:

python fine_tune.py

Modify hyperparameters in config.py as needed.
